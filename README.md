# PointToPoint motion
Basics for calculation point to point motion profiles based on the paper Mu, Haihua. (2009). THIRD ORDER POINT-TO-POINT MOTION-PROFILE. 
An excerpt of that paper can be found [here](https://www.jpe-innovations.com/page/precision-point/third-order-point-to-point-motion-profile/).

## Visualization
The project includes a WPF application which visualizes the resulting motion profiles.
