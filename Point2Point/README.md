- Mathematics
  Calculations for motion. SimpleP2P can not handle neither initial velocities or accelerations nor calculate braking distance.

  - MotionProfile
    Combines multiple P2P motions to calculate a motion that fullfills a list of constraints

    - ClearanceHandling
      Recalculates MotionProfiles based on clearances



- PoseCalculation
    Takes a ClearanceHandlingMotionProfile and returns poses at timestamps
